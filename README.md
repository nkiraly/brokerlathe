# BrokerLathe
BrokerLathe is a systems deployment and management project to deploy a highly available message broker with Apache Apollo and Hadoop on FreeBSD. It came about after researching message brokers with mission critical high volume message broker deployment and scaling needs.

# Approach
Using Ansbile playbooks and roles, configuration management and source controlled code changes, we wire several separate projects together to create a highly available message broker system running on FreeBSD nodes or jails.
